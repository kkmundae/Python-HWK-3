PyBank

I was provided with 86 months worth of financial data for a small company. There were two columns in the dataset, Date and Profit/Losses. In using this dataset, I was able to calculate the following
- total number of months in the dataset
- the net total of the Profits/Lsses over the period
- the average of the Profits/Lsses over the period
- month in which the company saw the gratest increase is profits and the greatest decrease in losses. 

I was then able to display this onto to the command screen and also create an output text file. 

PyPoll

For this exercise I was given a range of just under 4 million election poll results. in this dataset there are 3 columns, Voter ID, County and Candidate. The written script show the following results:
- total votes caste
- a list which shows Candidate Name, Percentage of Votes and Number of Votes recevied, 
- displays the winner of the election 

I was then able to display this onto to the commnd screen and also create an output text file.
